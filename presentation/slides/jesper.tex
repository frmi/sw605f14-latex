\begin{frame}{The First Sprint Review}
	This meeting had some fundamental problems:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item No feedback from the clients.
		\item Technical problems with the demonstrations.

\begin{frame}{Use of Scrum}
	Scrum only worked to a limited degree.\\
	\vspace{\baselineskip}
	It has been suggested to recommend another method (e.g. UP) to future teams.\\
	\vspace{\baselineskip}
	We however would recommend studying the chosen method extensively, and then implement it right.
