The internal dependencies between the various components of \giraf, necessitated several instances of ad hoc collaborations.

\launcher depends on other projects and vice versa, which caused some of unfortunate errors in both \launcher and other applications.
In this section, the most interesting of these collaborations are described.

One of the most interesting and recurring causes of errors, which cascaded through the \giraf project, was corrections or additions to the \textit{OasisLib} project.
The reasons for this, is that all applications use this library and the groups had no plan of when to update their version of \textit{OasisLib}.
This meant that the groups updated these dependencies independently of each other.
Since either the other groups still had not updated their dependencies or we had not updated ours, several problems arose.

An example of a change cascading through the project caused by \textit{OasisLib}, is a change where the type of an application ID was changed from a \lstinline|long| to an \lstinline|int|.
When we updated our \textit{OasisLib} we did not notice this change, as we store the \lstinline|int| value into a variable of type \lstinline|long|.
Since we are passing this value to the other applications, it created errors in them.
This caused a \lstinline!ClassCastException! in the other applications, since it is not possible to cast a \lstinline|long| to an \lstinline|int| without loosing precision.
We were notified when multiple groups suddenly started knocking our door.

Solving these problems required cooperation between the different groups.
