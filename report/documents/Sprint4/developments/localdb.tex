\subsection{Integration of the Local Database into Launcher}
\label{sec:developments:localdbtolauncher}
For an explanation of why the integration of the local database into \launcher is conducted, please refer to \Cref{sec:collab:localdbtolauncher}.\\

The process of integrating it with \launcher is fairly simple. 
The local database project consists of a single provider.
In order to start a provider/service from a dependency, the manifests of the projects have to be merged, moving the provider/service to the dependant manifest file.
