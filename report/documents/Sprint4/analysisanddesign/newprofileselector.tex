\subsection{New Profile Selector}\label{sec:sprint3:designprofileselector}

As mentioned in \cref{sec:sprint2:backlog}, the customer meetings held during the second sprint concluded that the \textbf{Profile Selector} should change.
More specifically should it be possible to switch between profiles both in \launcher and inside the other \giraf applications.
Therefore, the \textit{GIRAF Components} group was given the task of making a new Profile Selector for all groups to use.
The component is now available and is therefore implemented, both in \lstinline!HomeAcitivty! and in \lstinline!SettingsActivity!. 

The old Profile Selector was launched when an application was clicked in \lstinline!HomeActivity! and started the application with the selected profile as the user.

The new Profile Selector is launched when clicking the profile picture and it should return to be previous activity with a new user when a new profile is selected.

The implementation of the new Profile Selector is explained in \cref{sec:sprint3:devprofileselector}.
