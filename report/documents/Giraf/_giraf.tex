\chapter{GIRAF}\label{chap:giraf}
The term ``\giraf" describes the entire multi-project as an entity.
The suite of \giraf applications is developed iteratively at Aalborg University's Department of Computer Science, by software engineering students on the final semester of their bachelor.
The project was initiated in 2011 by Ulrik Nyman, Associate Professor at Aalborg University.
The project has subsequently evolved with each class of students, bringing new ideas to the project and improving on the existing applications.
Furthermore, the requirements from the clients has changed over time.

Overall, the multi-project is designed for various kinds of people.
The most important of which are the \textit{citizens}, for whom the applications were designed.
A \textit{citizen} refers to either a child or an adult person diagnosed with ASD.
Each citizen is supervised by another adult, referred to as being a \textit{guardian}.
This person is typically employed in one of the institutions affiliated with the \giraf project.
Thus, when referring to both, the term \textit{user} is used.

This chapter gives a more thorough introduction to the \giraf multi-project.
For a description of the development methodology employed, see \cref{sec:collab:multiproject}.

\section{\giraf Applications}\label{sec:giraf:applications}
The \giraf suite consists of several components, not least a multitude of front end applications, providing various features to the users. 
All front end applications are described in \Cref{sec:giraf:applications:frontend}. 
The suite also includes a number of back end components, allowing sharing and controlling data across every application. 
The back end components are described below.

\subsection{Back End Components}\label{sec:giraf:applications:backend}
Central to most of the Android applications is \textit{OasisLib}, which provides both models for the entire problem domain, and interfaces for retrieving data from the local database.
Every device has its own local database, with the goal of regular synchronization with a single remote database. 
Finally, \textit{\giraf Components} contains common user interface components with a uniform look-and-feel. 

\section{GIRAF Architecture}
\label{sec:giraf:architecture}
% SÃ¥dan er multiprojektet bygget op.
The \giraf system consists of several layers, as illustrated in \Cref{fig:girafLayers}.
At the top we have applications such as those described in \Cref{sec:giraf:applications:frontend}, which communicate with a local database on the device through the library \textit{OasisLib}.

\textit{\giraf Components} consists of multiple graphical components and provide common services to other \giraf applications.
As an example, a service that applications need is a profile selector.
This component allows a guardian to choose with which citizen they wish to work.
As a result, the process of choosing a citizen will be the same throughout \giraf.
