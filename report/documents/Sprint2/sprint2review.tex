\subsection{Evaluation}
The main task of this sprint has been to develop a prototype design of the settings activity in \launcher.
Multiple versions of the prototypes are presented to the clients present at each meeting.
They respond positively to the prototypes presented, even though problems are found in communicating our intentions with the designs.

As described in \cref{sec:oasismigration} problems arise when \textit{OasisLib} is updated.
The group is aware that the migration could have been handled with more grace, because other groups are dependant on \launcher.
Despite of this fact, the we agree that the group in charge of \textit{OasisLib} should have been more careful and use better software development practices when updating their API.

As the tasks of creating prototypes and holding meetings with the clients have been successfully completed, and the problems solved with new \textit{OasisLib} API, the sprint is considered to be a success.
