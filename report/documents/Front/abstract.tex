In cooperation between a number of institutions in Aalborg Municipality and Aalborg University, an Android system for autistic citizens and their guardians has been in development since 2011.
In January 2014, the project was taken over by the new 6th semester software engineering students, whom this group was a part of.

This report documents the progress of the group SW605F14 collaborating with the 15 other groups working on the project.
As the group mainly picked up the task of improving \launcher, the main application from which all other applications should be accessed, the report describes the continued analysis, client collaboration and development on this application.
Furthermore, the challenge of working within a multi-project setting is described, as are the advantages and problems this setting brings.

The project was developed over four sprints, and thus this report is divided into chapters concerning the activities carried out during each sprint.
