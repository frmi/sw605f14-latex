\chapter{Collaboration}\label{chap:collaboration}
A central element in working with a multi-project such as \giraf, is the collaboration between the several individual development teams. It is not enough to concentrate on developing individual components, but also necessary ensure that they actually function together. 
It is impossible to manage that many development teams without instilling a certain amount of formalism and discipline. 

This chapter describes how this group has been involved in these aspects of the multi-project.
