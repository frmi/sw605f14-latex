Half way through sprint one the semester coordinator, Ulrik Nyman, requested that at the end of the semester the applications should be available on Google Play.
This request made all groups, in the multiproject, realise that it would not be favourable to have the local database distributed as a stand-alone application since the \giraf system as a whole is depended on the data stored in the local database.
The reason for integrating the local database in \launcher is that most of the other applications in the \giraf system depends on data from the launcher and in that way they are required to be started from \launcher.

\Cref{sec:developments:localdbtolauncher} clarifies the technical aspect of the integration.
