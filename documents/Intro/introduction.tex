The desire for the latest technology, whether it be a new car that enhances the safety of driving it, a gesture enabled television set, or the latest mobile phones and tablets, often reflects a wish of improving certain areas of our lives using technology.
This report focuses on improving the way-of-life of citizens diagnosed with different kinds of \textit{Autism Spectrum Disorders} (ASD), including autism and Asperger syndrome.
The goal is to continue the development of an existing Android software suite for tablets, consisting of tools that seek to replace and improve some of the citizen's current tools for easing their daily routines. \\

This suite is called \textit{Graphical Interface Resources for Autistic Folk}, abbreviated \giraf.\\

Examples of \giraf applications include \textit{Livshistorier}, an interactive application that guides citizens in putting on their outdoor clothes in the best order, and \textit{Stemmespillet}, a game that focuses on training the voice of the speech-impaired citizens.
A subset of these applications is described briefly in \cref{sec:giraf:applications:frontend}.

\giraf is developed in cooperation with Aalborg Municipality, which has several institutions specializing in children and adults with various kinds of ASDs.
These institutions rely heavily on paper-based tools for their work with autistic citizens.
The idea behind \giraf is to organize and streamline these existing tools, by implementing them on Android tablets.
The institutions are considered the clients of \giraf, and therefore play a key role in guiding the developers, so \giraf can become as useful to them as possible.

The ideas of the clients are formalized by a group of students as a requirements specification and user stories, which contains requirements for the further development of each application, as described in \cref{appendix:requirements}.
