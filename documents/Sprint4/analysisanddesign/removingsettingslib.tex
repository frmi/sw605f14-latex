\subsection{Removing SettingsLib}
| * 5e22ec7 (8 days ago) thilemann@gmail.com Bye bye Settings-Lib, it was nice knowing you... Moved all used files into launcher project and deleted everything else. Settings-Lib is now completely part of la
uncher and no other application is dependent on it. Settings for other applications are opened through intents instead of directly inside Settings App.
