\subsection{New Profile Selector}

As mentioned in \cref{sec:sprint2:conclusionmeetings}, the customer meetings held during the second sprint concluded that the \textbf{Profile Selector} should change.
More specifically should it be possible to switch between profiles both in \launcher and inside the other \giraf applications.
Therefore, the \textbf{GUI} group was given the task of making a new Profile Selector for all groups to use.
The component is no available and is therefore implemented, both in \lstinline!HomeAcitivty! and in \lstinline!SettingsActivity!. 
The implementation of the new Profile Selector is explained in \cref{sec:sprint3:devprofileselector}.
