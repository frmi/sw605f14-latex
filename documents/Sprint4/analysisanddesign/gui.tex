\subsection{GIRAF Component widgets}
As described in \cref{sec:launcher:drawer}, the drawer pane of \launcher contained four widgets made by \textit{GIRAF Components}.
As this is the last sprint, the widgets that work should be enabled and those that are non-functional should be removed.
Therefore, the calender and connectivity widgets are removed and the profile selector was replaced with a new version.
The implementation of the selector is trivial and is therefore not described in \nameref{sec:sprint4:developments} (\cref{sec:sprint4:developments}).
