This sprint is dedicated to polishing the application, both in terms of visual effects and code structure.
The three main elements requiring explanation are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Improve the indication of time consuming application processes to the user.
\item Adjusting \launcher to the completed \textit{\giraf Components}.
\item Integrating the local database into the \launcher project.
\item Incorporation of the remote database.
\end{itemize}

The first element we describe is indicating time consuming processes in a favourable way to the user.
