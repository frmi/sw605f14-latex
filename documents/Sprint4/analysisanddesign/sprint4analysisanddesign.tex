This sprint was dedicated to polishing the application, both in terms of visual effects and code structure.
The three main elements requiring explanation are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Present time consuming tasks better to the user.
\item Adjusting \launcher to the completed \textit{GIRAF Components}.
\item Incorporation of the remote database.
\end{itemize}

The first element we describe is presenting time consuming tasks in a favourable way to the user.
