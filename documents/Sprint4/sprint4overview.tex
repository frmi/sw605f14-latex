Since the fourth sprint is the last one of this years development of the project, it is different from the other sprints.
First of all, the clients have put a significant emphasis on receiving working applications that do not crash.
While we cannot guarantee that \launcher will not crash during the eights months between the end of this sprint and the beginning of the next, we can improve the code to make \launcher as reliable as possible.\\

The third sprint left a backlog with a number of issues.
These issues are mostly related to either improving the existing code base, tying together well with the above paragraph, or improving the user experience with settings and \launcher in general.\vagner{jeg er ikke helt sikker på om jeg skal begynde at tale om den nye profile selector her... siden det ikke går ind under nogen af de to categorier}\\

After development of the application has been completed, a Usability Test is furthermore carried out to gain insight as to what improvements should be done to \launcher next year.
