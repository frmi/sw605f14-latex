\subsection{Refactoring LauncherUtility}\label{sect:sprint4:refactoring}

* | 3f60829 (8 days ago) tonaplo@msn.com Refactored the last part of LauncherUtility and commented some of the remaining functions.
* | 971f45f (8 days ago) tonaplo@msn.com Refactored GirafFragment to work like Android Fragment and removed some redundant calls to udateAppInfoHashMap
* | ae5936e (8 days ago) tonaplo@msn.com Removed all functions related to getting or checking applications to a new class called ApplicationControlUtility. Also removed two redundant functions.
Before refactoring, \lstinline!LauncherUtility! was  a 1200 lines long class with static methods for many different purposes.
By dividing the class into smaller classes, each with a certain purpose, the maintainability of the program will hopefully be increased and future developers will have an easier time understanding the code.
Furthermore, many of the existing functions were either simplified or removed due to lack of use or redundancy
