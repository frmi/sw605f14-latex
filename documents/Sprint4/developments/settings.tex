\subsection{Finishing up the ``Apps'' Pane}

The \textbf{Apps} pane is improved in a number of ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item Choosing a new profile loads the settings of the chosen user.
This was done by finishing this instances \lstinline|SettingsActivity| and then starting up a new instance of it with the new user as \lstinline|currentUser|.
\item When having loaded applications in \lstinline|GirafFragment| and \lstinline|AndroidFragment| once, selecting the panes subsequently does not cause the fragment to reload applications. This is a huge optimization.

In order to achieve this behaviour of the fragments we take advantage of the fragment life cycle in Android. This means that when a fragment is left Android marks the fragment as paused, and if it has not been used for some time Android will run its garbage collector and destroy the fragment. But if you return to the fragment before it is destroyed the views are still visible. Therefore we simply check if the layout in which the applications are contained is already instantiated, if this is the case we use the existing else we instantiate it over again.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{ViewHolder Design Pattern}
5c590d8 (9 days ago) sthile11@student.aau.dk Completely refactored SettingsListAdapter by implementing the ViewHolder design pattern to minimize calls to findViewById. This also made it possible to replace the methods responsible for setting visibility for each shadow view by a single method just setting the visibility.

\subsection{Background Loading of Applications}\label{sec:sprint4:dev:loadapplicationtask}
There are three \lstinline!View!s that get populated by applications in the \launcher project:

\begin{itemize}
\item The container in \lstinline!GirafFragment!, populated by \giraf applications only
\item The container in \lstinline!AndroidFragment!, populated by Android applications only
\item The main container in \lstinline!HomeActivity!, populated by both Android and \giraf applications
\end{itemize}

Since all three \lstinline!View!s needed some time to load the applications, it was deemed important to populate them off the UI thread.
Furthermore, populating all three \lstinline!View!s in the same way would also simplify the code.
Thus, the class \lstinline!LoadApplicationTask! has been created to load applications. 
It inherits from \lstinline!ASyncTask! and must therefore implement three methods:

\begin{itemize}
\item \lstinline!onPreExecute()! is called before the task is carried out and runs on the UI thread.
\item \lstinline!doInBackground()! should contain the task to be carried out and will carry it out in a background thread.
\item \lstinline!onPostExecute()! is called after the task has been carried out and runs on the UI thread.
\end{itemize}

We override \lstinline!onPreExecute()! and \lstinline!onPostExecute()! to start and stop showing a loading animation, respectively.

The method in \lstinline!LauncherUtility! used to populate a view with applications, \lstinline!loadApplications()! is deleted, and the contents are moved into \lstinline!doinBackground()!.
Since the views can only be manipulated in the UI thread, we add the applications as views to a list of views.
Once \lstinline!doinBackground()! finishes, \lstinline!onPostExecute()! the applications are added from the list to the target view. 
The constructor of \lstinline!LoadApplicationTask! is also adjusted to take as parameter all the information needed to populate a given view.

The observer which is observing new applications are are responsible for loading new applications, and is described in \cref{sec:sprint3:observing}, must be paused while added applications and restarted afterwards.
This happens in \lstinline!onPreExecute()! and \lstinline!onPostExecute()! respectively.

Because of the differences in the three classes which are loading applications, namely \lstinline!HomeActivity!, \lstinline!GirafFragment! and \lstinline!AndroidFragment!, we need to create a specialized version of the load application task for each class.
The reasons relate to the responsibility of the three classes;
\begin{itemize}
	\item Home activity has the responsibility to open applications when added,
	\item the GIRAF fragment and android fragment has the responsibility for marking applications as selected.
\end{itemize}
Even though the two fragments has the same responsibility the differ in the fact that the GIRAF fragment handles applications from the \giraf system and thereby does changes in the local database.
Whereas the android fragment handles selection of other Android applications, these selections are stored on the device.
An example of how one of these specialised tasks is shown in \cref{lst:derivedlat}.

To start the task for loading applications the observer is using a specialised version of the following code snippet.
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={A simplified code snippet for starting loading applications into a view.}, label={lst:simplelat}]
LoadApplicationTask lat = new LoadApplicationTask(context, currentUser, guardianUser, targetView, iconsize, onClickListener);
loadApplicationTask.execute(applicationsToLoad);
\end{lstlisting}
