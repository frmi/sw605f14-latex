\subsection{Finishing up SettingsActivity}

\subsubsection{Finishing up the ''Apps'' Pane}
| | * | | c553b1f (13 days ago) fmikke11@student.aau.dk Preferences are now saved per user
* fcf48a8 (9 days ago) fmikke11@student.aau.dk Settings are now reflected on giraf apps as well when changing profile
| * | cd0ee43 (9 days ago) fmikke11@student.aau.dk Settings are now profile individual, and is reflected on the home screen except giraf apps

\subsubsection{LoadApplicationTask}\vagner{Finish this subsection}
There are three \lstinline!View!s that get populated by apps in the \launcher project:

\begin{itemize}
\item The container in \lstinline!GirafFragment!, populated by \giraf applications only
\item The container in \lstinline!AndroidFragment!, populated by Android applications only
\item The main container in \lstinline!HomeActivity!, populated by both Android and \giraf applications
\end{itemize}

Since all three \lstinline!View!s needed some time to load the applications, it was deemed important to populate them off the UI thread.
Furthermore, populating all three \lstinline!View!s in the same way would also simplify the code.
