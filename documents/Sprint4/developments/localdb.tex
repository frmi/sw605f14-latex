\subsection{Integration of the local database into \launcher}
\label{sec:developments:localdbtolauncher}
For explanations on why the integration of the local database in to \launcher was requested please refer to \Cref{sec:collab:localdbtolauncher}.\\

It was required that the local database was integrated to the launcher for distribution reasons.
The process of integrating it with \launcher was fairly simple. 
The local database project consists of a single provider.
In order to start a provider/service from a dependency the Android manifests has to be merged, moving the provider/service to the \launcher manifest file.
