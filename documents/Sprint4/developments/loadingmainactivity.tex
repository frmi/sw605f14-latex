\subsection{Background loading on startup}\label{sec:sprint4:dev:remotedbandbgloading}

Implementing the background loader for \lstinline|MainActivity| is done the same way as when loading applications, described in \cref{sec:sprint4:dev:loadapplicationtask}, but with minor changes.
The same choice of deriving from \lstinline!ASyncTask! is made and the derived class is called \lstinline!LoadDataTask!.

Upon starting \launcher a one second animation is shown, bringing the logo into view.
In case the is no new data to get, this makes \lstinline!MainActivty! be shown for at least one second before launching the next activity.\\

The starting animation is attached an \lstinline!AnimationListener!, which implements \lstinline|onAnimationEnd()|.
Once the animation ends, this function initiates the \lstinline!LoadDataTask! and calls \lstinline!loadDataTask.execute()! for make it run.

A text view containing information about the current state is also updated to display a welcome message, a loading message and finally a ready message, once \lstinline|LoadDataTask| calls \lstinline|onPostExecute()|.\\

When this background loader is implemented, the data to be loaded consisted of some test data generated by \textit{OasisLib}.
However, just before the deadline of this sprint, the \textit{RemoteDataBase} and \textit{OasisLib} groups had finished implementing communication between the local database on the tablet and the remote one on the server.
As a result, we were asked to add one line of code, starting the synchronization between the two databases, to the published version of \launcher, instead of only using the local database.\\

This one line of code introduced some issues, described further in \cref{sec:collab:remotedb}.
