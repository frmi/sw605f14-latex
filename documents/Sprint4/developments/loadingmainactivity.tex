\subsection{Background Loading During Startup}\label{sec:sprint4:dev:remotedbandbgloading}

Implementing the background loader for \lstinline|MainActivity| is done the same way as when loading applications, described in the previous section, but with minor changes.
The same choice of deriving from \lstinline!ASyncTask! is made and the derived class is called \lstinline!LoadDataTask!.

Upon starting \launcher, a one-second animation is shown, bringing the logo into view, before the activity starts loading data.
As a result, in case there is no new data, \mainactivty is shown for at least one second before launching the next activity.\\

An \lstinline!AnimationListener! is attached to the starting animation, which implements \lstinline|onAnimationEnd()|.
Once the animation ends, this function initiates the \lstinline!LoadDataTask! and calls \lstinline!loadDataTask.execute()! to make it run.

A text view containing information about the current state is also updated to display a welcome message, a loading message during \lstinline|doInBackground()|, and finally a ready message, once \lstinline|onPostExecute()| is called.\\

When this background loader is implemented, the data to be loaded consists of some test data generated by \textit{OasisLib}.
However, just before the deadline of this sprint, the implementation of the communication between the local database on the tablet and the remote one on the server is finished.
As a result, we are asked to add one line of code, starting the synchronization between the two databases, to the published version of \launcher, instead of only using the local database.\\

This one line of code introduced some issues, described further in \cref{sec:collab:remotedb}.
