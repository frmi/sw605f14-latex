\subsection{Implement new Profile Selector}\label{sec:sprint3:devprofileselector}
As described in \cref{sec:sprint3:designprofileselector}, the new Profile Selector is ready to be implemented.

It was implemented by adding the \lstinline!GWidgetProfileSelection! as a view in the \lstinline|home.xml| and \lstinline|settings.xml| files.
This is the button showing the profile picture of the current user.
This component is attached an \lstinline!OnClickListener!, which shows the profile selector dialog box, \lstinline!GProfileSelector!, with a call to \lstinline!GWidgetProfileSelection.show()!.

The \lstinline!GProfileSelector! object is instantiated as such:

\begin{center}
\lstinline!mProfileSelectorDialog = new GProfileSelector(mContext, mLoggedInGuardian, mCurrentUser);!
\end{center}

However, this way of instantiating the object means that every time a new user is chosen on the list, the selector must be instantiated again with a new current user.

The solution was to create a function called \lstinline|updatesProfileSelector()|, which attaches an \lstinline!OnListItemClickListener! to the \lstinline!GWidgetProfileSelection!.
Firing the click event, the selector instantiates itself again and runs \lstinline|updatesProfileSelector()| to attach the listener to the new instance.
This ensures that the selector is always correctly updates with the current user.
\lstinline|updatesProfileSelector()| can be seen in \cref{appendix:codeexamples}.

Adding this new profile selector, allowed us to remove the \launcher classes filling this role, \lstinline!ProfileLauncher! and \lstinline!ProfileSelectActivity!, since the new selector should never be called when starting an application.
