This report is created by Software Engineering students as a Bachelor project at Aalborg University, spring semester 2014.
To read and understand the report, it is expected that the reader has a background in Computer Science in the light of the technical contents.
The Android APIs are not described directly in this report and thus the reader is encouraged to explore the introduction to Android given by \citet{androidIntroduction}.

The project itself is a multi project, where 16 bachelor groups have collaborated to create an Android system for autistic citizens and their guardians.
The multi project has been in progress since 2011 and is a collaboration between Aalborg Municipality, Aalborg University and several institutions for autistic citizens.

The multi project as a whole is described in \cref{chap:giraf}.\\
\thilemann{Cite af multi-project guidelines?}
Since multiple project groups are collaborating towards developing a complete system, it is specified by the multi-project guidelines, that the groups must work in four sprints.
The structure of this report is divided into chapters that logically follows from these guidelines.
Each sprint chapter is then further subdivided into sections that are similar for each sprint.
A section can for example be ``Analysis and Design'' and ``Developments'', even though a particular section is only added if its describing activity has been present during the specific sprint.\\

It is important to note, that the applications in the multi project were renamed during this semester.
As a result, many applications have been given Danish names which will not be translated in this report.

References and citations are given with number notation, for example as: \citet{launcher2011}, or without listing the authors as: \cite{launcher2011}. 

We would like to thank our lecturers and our supervisor, Hua Lu for excellent cooperation during the project work.
Furthermore, we would like to thank the other project groups for the educational collaboration performed during the project.
\jesper[inline]{Fix this up in the end.}
