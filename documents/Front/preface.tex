This report is created by Software Engineering students as a Bachelor project at Aalborg University, spring semester 2014.
To read and understand the report, it is expected that the reader has a background in Computer Science in the light of the technical contents.


Since multiple project groups are collaborating towards developing a complete system, the structure of this report is divided into chapters that logically follows from working in sprints specified by the multi-project guidelines.
Thus there is a chapter for each sprint, which is further subdivided into:

\thilemann{Maybe add small description of each section}

\begin{itemize}
\item Sprint Overview
\item Analysis and Design
\item Developments
\item Sprint Review
\end{itemize}

Following the chapters describing the four sprints, \cref{chap:collaboration} focuses on the work that is done in collaboration with other groups.
Lastly, the results of the project is presented in \cref{chap:evaluation}.

References and citations is given with number notation, for example \thilemann{Indsæt eksempel på cite her.}. 
When writing "we", it is referring to the members of the project group.
