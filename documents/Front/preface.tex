This report is created by Software Engineering students as a Bachelor project at Aalborg University, spring semester 2014.
To read and understand the report, it is expected that the reader has a background in Computer Science in the light of the technical contents.


Since multiple project groups are collaborating towards developing a complete system, the structure of this report is divided into chapters that logically follows from working in sprints specified by the multi-project guidelines.
Thus there is a chapter for each sprint, which is further subdivided into:\vagner{please verify that this is what the different sections are about.}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Sprint Overview:}\\
These sections describe the overall purpose of the sprint and its backlog
\item \textit{Analysis and Design:}\\
These sections acknowledge the pre-emptive work carried out during a sprint
\item \textit{Developments:}\\
These sections details what was developed and how it was developed during the sprint 
\item \textit{Sprint Review:}\\
These sections treats whether the sprint was successful or not and which improvements could be made
\end{itemize}

Following the chapters describing the four sprints, \cref{chap:collaboration} focuses on the work that is done in collaboration with other groups.
Lastly, the results of the project is presented in \cref{chap:evaluation}.

References and citations are given with number notation, for example \citet{launcher2011} or \cite{launcher2011}. 

When writing "we", it is referring to the members of the project group.

We would like to thank our lecturers and our supervisor, Hua Lu for excellent cooporation during the project work.
