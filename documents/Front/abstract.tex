In a cooperation between a number of institutions of Aalborg Municipality, and Aalborg University, an Android system for autistic citizens and their guardians has been in development since 2011.
In January 2014, the project was taken over by the new 6th semester software engineering students, whom this group was a part of.

This report documents the progress of the group SW605f14 in collaborating with the fifteen other groups working on the project.
As the group mainly picked up the task of the improving \launcher, the main application from which all other applications should be accessed, the report describes the continued analysis, customer collaboration and development on this application.
Furthermore, the challenge of working within a multi-project setting is described, as are the advantages and problems.

As the project was developed over four sprints, so is the report divided into chapters concerning the activities carried out during each sprint.
