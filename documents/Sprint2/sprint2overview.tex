Having completed all remaining task from the first sprint, the second is about making a foundation for future work.
The idea of creating a settings button in \launcher is explored by the means of prototypes and client meetings.

As the described in \cref{sec:sprint1:review}, the end of the first sprint left us unsure of whether there was more work to be done on \launcher, and if so, what this work could be. 
The necessity of arranging a meeting with some of the clients is decided, in part to hear their thoughts on the current version of \launcher, and in part to discover new features.
During the first sprint we informally discussed ideas for new features.
These features include an improved format for the profile selector, and a new \settingsactivity and providing a uniform interface for changing settings across all applications. 
To provide a good foundation for presenting and discussing these ideas with the clients, a number of prototype drawings are designed to illustrate how our initial thoughts can be realized.

Another important issue in this sprint is adapting \launcher for new versions of its dependencies, among these \textit{OasisLib}.
The library underwent drastic changes at the end of the first sprint, which unfortunately resulted in several applications, including \launcher, being unable to run.
