\thilemann[inline]{The text below is taken from first sprint review - it should be adapted to this section instead}
As a consequence of the lacking feedback, the \launcher sub-project had no clear goals for the second sprint, as most obvious issues had been resolved during the first sprint.
We therefore decided to get in contact with one of the costumers early in the second sprint, and discuss \launcher.
We then expect to able to build a backlog for the second sprint along with this costumer.
This is not an optimal solution, as the backlog should be compiled and prioritized as part of a coherent development process.\thilemann{Meaning what?}
But this solution will at least give us the ability to work from the requests of a costumer, rather than from what we ourselves believes the costumers want.
This costumer contact will be discussed further in \jesper{Ref til afsnit om kundekontakt, sprint 2.}
