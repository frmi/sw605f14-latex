\subsection*{Evaluation}

The main task of the sprint was to have a design of the Settings.
Furthermore, the \textit{OasisLib} group updated their API, and \launcher needed to be updated to utilize the new API correctly.
Both tasks have been successfully completed and the sprint was an overall success. \\

The Sprint End meeting is handled by a member of this group and is therefore describe in the \nameref{chap:collaboration} chapter, in \cref{collab:sprintendtwo}.

\subsection*{Backlog}

Since this sprint ended with having a design for the settings, the backlog for the next sprint contains the task of implementing the design.

As has happened this sprint, it is also inevitable that changes to dependencies will affect our work in the coming sprints.
This added time will be accounted for.
