\subsection{Prototypes}\label{sec:sprint2:prototypes}

At the end of first sprint, the existing features of \launcher were polished, and the project would only need to be kept updated with the implementation of the new \textit{OasisLib} database.
The group thought it could be desirable for \launcher to have additional features:

\begin{itemize}
\item It might be useful to be able to change profiles at other occasions than when starting an application, possibly in \launcher or in the started application.
\item Settings for the different applications could be set from an activity accessed from \launcher.
\item Permissions for which applications users can access could likewise be set from \launcher.
\end{itemize}

It was decided to have a brainstorm to gather ideas regarding these features, create prototypes of the best ones\footnote{The prototypes regarded as being the best, were deemed so by the project group.} and present these to the clients for feedback.

The prototypes created were \textbf{low fidelity}, \textbf{horizontal} prototypes, as described in \citet[p. 184-195]{debBook}, made partly with screenshots of existing functionality and partly with the modelling tool Gliffy (\citet{gliffy}).
The purpose was to convey several different ways of including the above features, while not spending too much time creating them.

\subsubsection{Profile Selection}

At the end of sprint one, the profile selection would only appear when launching an application, as illustrated by the state chart diagram in \Cref{fig:statechartProfileSelectorInitial}.
\insertfigure{width=\textwidth}{statechartProfileSelectorInitial}{State chart diagram for the original process of choosing a profile.}{fig:statechartProfileSelectorInitial}
Two alternatives are suggested:
\begin{itemize}
\item Selection of a different profile from within \launcher.
This will work by pressing the profile picture, giving a list of profiles to choose from.
Being relevant only for a guardian, the profiles selectable should only be the guardian itself and a related citizen.

\item Selection of another active profile from within each individual application.
While this solution does not require any modification of \launcher, it would mean that each application has its own profile selection button.
As a result, a user does not have to exit an application simply to change profile.
\end{itemize}

Common for both alternatives is to display the currently selected profile at the top of the sidebar.
Illustrations can be seen in \Cref{fig:profileselectionlauncherdropdown,fig:profileselectionapppopup} respectively. For an explanation of the suggested process of choosing a profile, see the state chart diagram in \Cref{fig:statechartProfileSelectorBubble}.

\subsubsection{Settings}\label{sec:sprint2:prototypes:settings}

At the end of first sprint, settings for different applications where handled inside the applications exclusively.
The idea of centralizing the settings for the different applications was formed both to streamline data for the database, but also to grant the user a better overview over the settings shared by applications.

Again, two alternatives are presented:
\begin{itemize}
\item A settings activity, accessible from \launcher only.
This activity will contain settings for all applications enabled for the selected user, as well as selecting which applications should be enabled for that user.
This also includes the native Android settings.
\item Letting each application have a settings button, where settings native to each application can be set.
\end{itemize}

The first option is the most encompassing one, containing functionality for both manipulating settings for other applications and to decide which applications can be used by different users.
It is furthermore discussed to add functionality allowing a user to add applications from Google Play to \launcher.
The settings part of the activity can be seen in \Cref{fig:settingsprototype}, while the application management part can be seen in \Cref{fig:appsmanagement}.

The second option is more centred on making the settings activity streamlined across applications and would thus be a cooperative project with the \textit{GIRAF Components} group.
An example of settings for \launcher can be seen in \Cref{fig:appsettingsprototype}.

\subsubsection{Profile Info}

The group had an idea of displaying information about the active user in the drawer section of \launcher.
This is a relatively small feature that would be trivial to implement.
An example can be seen in \Cref{fig:profileinfo}.
