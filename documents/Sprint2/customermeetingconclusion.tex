\subsection{Conclusion of Customer Meetings}\label{sec:sprint2:conclusionmeetings}

As apparent from \cref{sec:sprint2:firstmeeting,sec:sprint2:secondmeeting}, the customers are in general enthusiastic about the presented prototypes.
While smaller adjustments are needed to fit their requirements, much of the work done is ready to be implemented.

The requirements specified by the customers can be outlined the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item A profile selection feature available both from \launcher and from within each individual application.
\item A settings feature for all enabled applications accessible from \launcher and one for each individual application.
\item Ability to add external (Android) applications to \launcher.
\item Ability to copy settings from one user profile to another within both versions of the settings feature.
\item Ability to enable and disable applications on a per-user basis within the \launcher settings tool.
\item Ability to add applications to \launcher from the Google Play store from the \launcher settings tool.
\item When attempting to exit an application while \textit{Timer} runs as an overlay, only that application should be accessible until time runs out.
\item Since it is not possible to take ownership of the standard Android `Home', `Back' and `Multitasking' buttons unless the ActionBar is implemented (\citet{onOverridingHomeButtons}), an exhaustive search have to be made to ensure the requirement can not be fulfilled.
\end{itemize}

Note that other requirements have been discovered as well, but is outside the scope of \launcher.\footnote{As an example can be mentioned the requirement of \textit{Timer} as an overlay for each open application.}
Furthermore, it is found that the drawer functionality is not a requirement in, along with the ability to change colours of an specific application on a per-user basis.

These requirements provides the group with a solid backlog for the next sprint (\cref{chap:sprint3}).
