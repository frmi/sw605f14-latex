\subsubsection{Loading Apps into View}\label{sec:sprint:designlauncher}
The methods that load applications into a given view are in \lstinline!HomeActivity!.
In \lstinline!SettingsActivity! the pane where applications are added and removed from users also needs to load applications into a given view.
Therefore, we refactor \lstinline!HomeActivity! and move the relevant functions into \lstinline!LauncherUtility!.
Then both activities can call the same method and code redundancy is reduced.
