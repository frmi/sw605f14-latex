\subsection{Design of Settings Activity}\label{sec:sprint3:designsettings}
\thilemann{The settings activity should be better introduced - we have not yet talked about it, so talking about settings activity makes not sense! Should be an extension of the prototypes we made}
Here, the organization of the settings activity is described.
This includes the general analysis, design and structure of the activity.
\vagner{REMEMBER that this is ONLY sprint 3, so we only describe the basics here! Also, remember to add a nice figure, showing the structure.}

\subsubsection{Loading Apps into View}\label{sec:sprint:designlauncher}

The methods that load applications into a given view are in \lstinline!HomeActivity!.
In \lstinline!SettingsActivity! the pane where applications are added and removed from users also needs to load applications into a given view.
Therefore, we refactor \lstinline!HomeActivity! and move the relevant functions into \lstinline!LauncherUtility!.
Then both activities can call the same method and code redundancy is reduced.
