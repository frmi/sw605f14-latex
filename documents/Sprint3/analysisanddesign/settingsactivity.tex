\subsection{Design of Settings Activity}\label{sec:sprint3:designsettings}
\thilemann{The settings activity should be better introduced - we have not yet talked about it, so talking about settings activity makes not sense! Should be an extension of the prototypes we made}
Here, the organization of the settings activity is described.
This includes the general analysis, design and structure of the activity.

\frederik[inline]{Jeg ved ikke hvor foelgende hoerer til}
\thilemann[inline]{Jeg tror det var da alle views med ikoner blev konverteret til bitmaps for bedre at skalere ikoner?}
{\color{red}* | ed2d9a5 (3 weeks ago) fmikke11@student.aau.dk changed views to imageViews. Apps are now shown as Bitmaps}

\subsubsection{Loading Apps into View}\label{sec:sprint:designlauncher}

The methods that load applications into a given view are in \lstinline!HomeActivity!.
In \lstinline!SettingsActivity! the pane where applications are added and removed from users also needs to load applications into a given view.
Therefore, we refactor \lstinline!HomeActivity! and move the relevant functions into \lstinline!LauncherUtility!.
Then both activities can call the same method and code redundancy is reduced.
