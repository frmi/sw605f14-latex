\subsection{Disabling the Drawer}
As described in \vagner{add reference to Customer Meeting}, the purpose of the drawer is founded in a misinterpretation.
It was thought that it was important to be able to colour the different applications in \launcher.
However, at the meeting it was clarified that it was important to be able to toggle \textit{pictograms} from being in colour to black and white, since some citizens handle coloured picture better than black and white ones and vice versa.\\

There are some additional problems with the drawer.
These are mostly centered upon other applications absorbing the colour given to them by \launcher and using that colour as their main theme.
However, this means that for each possible colour the \launcher can give an application, it needs to implement a colour scheme that fits with the given colour.
This is especially a problem for application using a wide variety of colours.\\

Since the purpose of the drawer is not a requirement per se, and the functionality caused problems in other applications, it was decided to disable the drawer.
The source code still contains all the code needed for the drawer to be re-enabled, with comments as to why it has been disabled.
This way, should a future group need to implement the drawer, they merely have to uncomment part of the code.
