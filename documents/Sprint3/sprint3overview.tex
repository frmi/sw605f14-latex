We chose to work with \launcher in the third sprint as well.\vagner{Again, shouldnt we just mention it in the beginning, we always work with launcher?}

This sprint is mainly focused on implementation of the settings and the technical details of the implementation are therefore explained in this chapter.\vagner{add abit more text}
