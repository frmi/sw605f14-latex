\subsection{Settings specific to Launcher}
The Implementation of the settings for \launcher, as described in \cref{sec:launchersettings}, is elaborated in this section.
Since these settings are exclusive to \launcher and thus possible to open within \settingsactivity by implementing them as a fragment, they will be available in the \textit{Settings Container} as shown in \cref{fig:settingsarchitecture}.
This is in fact equivalent to the \lstinline|FrameLayout| called \textit{settingsContainer} as illustrated in \cref{lst:settingsactivity:layout}.
