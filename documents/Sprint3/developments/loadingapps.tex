\subsection{LauncherUtility and Loading Apps}\label{sect:sprint3:refactoring}
In order to implement the \lstinline!SettingsActivity! much of the existing code needed to be refactored.
This was especially due to the need of loading Android applications that are not part of the GIRAF framework \vagner{framework? Project?} into the Launcher. 
\vagner{Once again, remember that this is Sprint 3 and should therefore only be the things included in sprint 3!}

\subsubsection{Refactoring of LauncherUtility}
* | | 01e1fae (13 days ago) thilemann@gmail.com Refactored how items are added to the list of applications. They are now added through either addApplicationByName or addApplicationByPackageName. addApplicati
onByPackageName is always preferred over the other, since it application name and icon are added dynamically by the packagename supplied. addApplicationByName is used when adding settings not part of a packa
ge, such as the one added for Android.\\
