\subsection{Refactoring}\label{sect:sprint3:refactoring}
In order to implement the \lstinline!SettingsActivity! much of the existing code needed to be refactored.
This was especially due to the need of loading Android applications that are not part of the GIRAF framework \vagner{framework? Project?} into the Launcher. 
\vagner{Once again, remember that this is Sprint 3 and should therefore only be the things included in sprint 3!}

\subsubsection{Minor changes}

\subsubsection{Refactoring of LauncherUtility}
* | | 01e1fae (13 days ago) thilemann@gmail.com Refactored how items are added to the list of applications. They are now added through either addApplicationByName or addApplicationByPackageName. addApplicati
onByPackageName is always preferred over the other, since it application name and icon are added dynamically by the packagename supplied. addApplicationByName is used when adding settings not part of a packa
ge, such as the one added for Android.\\

* | 81c62b6 (2 weeks ago) sthile11@student.aau.dk Refactored whole Settings App to better comply with Google Developers guidelines and handle fragment to activity communication through an interface callback.Design of individual list items is managed through the custom list adapter SettingsListAdapter instead of in the list itself to be able to handle onClick events in containing activity (through the interface
 callback)\\
 
 \subsubsection{The Appwatcher class}
 * | 6b4112c (3 weeks ago) fmikke11@student.aau.dk Added feature to automatically detect and show newly installed applciations.\frederik{Vagner skriver at dette nok skal skrives af Frederik eller Jesper, siden det var dem der lavede den f√∏rste version af dette.}
 
 \subsubsection{Guardian only apps no longer requires selecting a child}
 | * 84d80e1 (3 weeks ago) jesper.b.kjaer@gmail.com Added constant string of arrays with names of apps that are guardian-only. These apps no longer present a profile selection screen when launched.\\
