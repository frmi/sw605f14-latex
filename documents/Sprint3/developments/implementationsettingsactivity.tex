 * | f4346e2 (2 weeks ago) thilemann@gmail.com Added button to access Android Settings from giraf settings app and cleaned up the onclicklistener for google play button and removed bold fontface from tab buttons when active\\
 
 \subsubsection{Starting settings of other apps from Settings}
 * | | c51e137 (7 days ago) thilemann@gmail.com Cleaned file and removed unnecessary intent-filter from SettingsActivity. This activity should not be available through an intent.
 * | bd0c2c7 (7 days ago) thilemann@gmail.com When adding an intent by packagename there were no checks that the intent indeed contains the action needed to start the settings of the application. This is now
 handled so it is not added to the list if it does not exist.
 * | | | 6f19b2e (7 days ago) thilemann@gmail.com Added Sequence (Zebra) to settings
 | * | | 0bb96b3 (7 days ago) jesper.b.kjaer@gmail.com Added handling of ActivityNotFound exception in settings.
