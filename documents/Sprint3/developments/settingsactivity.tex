\subsection{The Settings Activity}\label{sec:sprint3:settings}

The main responsibility of this class is responding to updates from the components it contains, and also inflating the layout seen in \cref{lst:settingsactivity:layout}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Excerpt of the layout defined for \lstinline|SettingsActivity|.}, label={lst:settingsactivity:layout}]
<fragment
  android:id="@+id/settingsListFragment"
  android:layout_weight="2"
  class="dk.aau.cs.giraf.launcher.settings.SettingsListFragment"
</fragment>

<FrameLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
  android:id="@+id/settingsContainer"
  android:layout_weight="6">
</FrameLayout>
\end{lstlisting}

The layout is fairly simple, since it is not responsible for rendering any dynamic content other than displaying what is to be contained within the activity.
Instead it defines two containers.
The first is the \lstinline|<fragment>| element, which is the Android way of defining a static fragment that can not be changed after instantiation.
As indicated by the \lstinline|class| attribute, it is inflating the \lstinline|SettingsListFragment|, which purpose is explained in \cref{sec:settingslistfragment}.
The second container is a \lstinline|FrameLayout|, which contains the settings selected from \lstinline|SettingsListFragment|.
This layout is equivalent to the \textit{Settings Container} illustrated in \cref{fig:settingsprototype}.

Since Android disapproves of inter-fragment communication, \lstinline|SettingsActivity| will have to stand between and respond to requests send from its active fragments.
This is done by implementing the \lstinline|SettingsListFragmentListener| interface to define methods for what the \lstinline|SettingsListFragment| wants to communicate, as seen in \cref{lst:settingslistfragment:interface}.
Defining the methods of the interface, no coupling between the fragment and activity exist because the fragment does not know of the activity.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={The interface implemented in \lstinline|SettingsActivity| defined in \lstinline|SettingsListFragment|.}, label={lst:settingslistfragment:interface}]
public interface SettingsListFragmentListener {
  public void setActiveFragment(Fragment fragment);
  public void reloadActivity();
  public ArrayList<SettingsListItem> getInstalledSettingsApps();
  public void setCurrentUser(Profile profile);
}
\end{lstlisting}
