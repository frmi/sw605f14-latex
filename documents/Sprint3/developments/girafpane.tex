\subsubsection{Launcher Settings}
The settings which are directly in connection with \launcher are presented in \cref{fig:prototypes}.

The available settings are:
\begin{itemize}
 	\item Disabling the start animation, when starting \launcher the first time after a system restart.
 	\item Changing the size of application icons in  \homeactivity.
\end{itemize} 

These are added as suggestions of relevant \launcher settings as outlined in \cref{sec:sprint2:prototypes:settings}.

The most interesting of the two settings is the icon scaling, since ``Show start up animation" is created with a standard Android preference component\footnote{``Preferences'' in Android terminology is what we refer to as ``settings''.}, providing the layout with a two-state switch.

The icon scaling is created by extending the standard \lstinline|Preference| class in Android, thereby inheriting the native setup, i.e. title and summery fields, and constructors for such a component.
We supplement it with a custom layout containing a slider and an application icon, as well as providing functionality to react when the slider changes its position.
