The settings which are directly in connection with \launcher is presented in \cref{fig:prototypes}.

The settings are further outlined below,
\begin{itemize}
 	\item disabling of the start animation, when starting \launcher the first time after a system restart,
 	\item and changing the size of application icons on the home activity.
\end{itemize} 
These were added as suggestions of relevant \launcher settings in \cref{sec:sprint2:prototypes:settings} and they made it to the final release.

The most interesting of the two preferences is the icon scaling, since ``Show start up animation" is created with a standard Android preference component, providing the layout with a two-state switch.

The icon scaling is created by extending the standard preference class in Android, thereby inheriting the native setup, i.e. title and summery fields, and constructors for such a component.
We supplement it with a custom layout containing a slider and an application icon, as well as providing functionality to react when the slider changed it position.\\\\
Next, we describe the ''Apps'' pane.
