The settings which are directly in connection with \launcher is presented in \cref{fig:prototypes}.

The settings are further outlined below,
\begin{itemize}
 	\item disabling of the start animation, when starting \launcher the first time after a system restart,
 	\item and changing the size of application icons on the home activity.
\end{itemize} 
It should be noted that these settings are added as suggestions to which settings could be relevant and they made it to the final release.

The most interesting of the two preferences is the icon scaling preference, since the ``Show start up animation" preference is created with a standard Android preference component which provides the layout with a two-state switch.

The icon scaling preference is created by extending the standard preference class in Android thereby inheriting the native setup, e.g. title and summery fields, and constructors for such a component.
We have then supplied it with a custom layout containing a slider and an application icon as those used in the home activity. As well as providing functionality to react when the slider changed it position.
