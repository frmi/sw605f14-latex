\chapter{Third Sprint}\label{chap:sprint3}
We chose to work with \launcher in the third sprint as well.\vagner{Again, shouldnt we just mention it in the beginning, we always work with launcher?}
The customers feedback to the prototypes in the second sprint provided vital information about the important parts of the settings, and we have a complete overview of how the settings should be implemented.
This sprint is mainly focused on implementation of the settings and the technical details of the implementation are therefore explained in this chapter.
