\subsection{Evaluation}
Overall, the first sprint was a success for the group.
All task were finished and \launcher is now ready for the sprint review together with the clients, receiving feedback regarding the next steps.

However, for various reasons, the meeting does not yield the desired results for planning the next sprint.
Therefore, the groups decide to appoint a single person responsible for planning and executing this meeting in the future.
The chosen person is from this group, so the details of this and later sprint reviews are discussed in depth in \cref{sec:collab:sprintend}.

\subsection{Backlog}
As mentioned above we did not get any feedback during the sprint review to use for planning our next sprint.
We still think there are elements to improve in \launcher, but we cannot immediately continue the development, before having explored whether the clients have further requirements for the application.
These are explored in \cref{sec:sprint2:overview}.
