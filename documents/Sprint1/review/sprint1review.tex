\thilemann{Introductions before each sprint end?}

\subsection{Evaluation}

Overall, the first sprint was a success for the group.
All task were finished and the \launcher is ready for the Sprint End presentation together with the clients, receiving feedback regarding the next steps.\thilemann{Should be sprint review, not sprint end?}

However, for various reasons, the meeting does not yield the desired results for planning the next sprint.
Therefore, the groups decide to appoint a single person responsible for planning and executing this meeting in the future.
The chosen person is from this group, so the details of this and later sprint review meetings are discussed in depth in \cref{sec:collab:sprintend}.

\subsection{Backlog}
\thilemann[inline]{Needs rephrasing}
Since we are not able to get any feedback on our progress with \launcher, and following our own opinion, we have little more to do to improve on the existing features, it is not immediately possible to continue development during the next sprint. 
As described in \cref{sec:sprint2:overview}, we have to explore whether the clients have further requirements for \launcher.
