This first sprint culminated in a meeting, where the groups presented their progress to the clients.
For various reasons, this meeting did not yield the desired results, a plan for the next sprint.
Therefore the groups decide to appoint a single person responsible for planning and executing this meeting in the future.
The chosen person is from this group, so the details of this and later sprint end meetings will be discussed in depth in \cref{sec:collab:sprintend}.
