This first sprint culminated in a meeting, where the groups presented their progress to the clients.
For various reasons, this meeting did not yield the desired results, a plan for the next sprint.
Therefore the groups decide to appoint a single person responsible for planning and executing this meeting in the future.
The chosen person is from this group, so the details of this and later sprint review meetings will be discussed in depth in \cref{sec:collab:sprintend}.

Since we were not able to get any feedback on our progress with \launcher, and there, in our opinion, was little more to do to improve on the existing features, we could not immediately continue development on the next sprint. As described in \cref{sec:sprint2:overview}, we would have to explore whether the clients had further requirements for \launcher.
