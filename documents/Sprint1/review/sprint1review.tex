\subsection{Evaluation}

Overall, the first sprint was a success for the group.
All task were finished and the \launcher is ready for the  Sprint End presentation to the customers and feedback regarding the next steps.

However, for various reasons, the meeting does not yield the desired results, a plan for the next sprint.
Therefore, the groups decide to appoint a single person responsible for planning and executing this meeting in the future.
The chosen person is from this group, so the details of this and later sprint review meetings will be discussed in depth in \cref{sec:collab:sprintend}.

\subsection{Backlog}
Since we are not able to get any feedback on our progress with \launcher, and there, in our opinion, was little more to do to improve on the existing features, we could not immediately continue development on the next sprint. 
As described in \cref{sec:sprint2:overview}, we have to explore whether the clients have further requirements for \launcher.
