As we are using the Scrum method of development for the entire \giraf project, a sprint review meeting is planned for the end of the iteration. 
\citet[p. 71]{larmanAgile} describes this type of meeting as follows:
\begin{quote}
``At the end of each iteration, there is a review meeting (maximum of four hours)
hosted by the Scrum Master.
The team, Product Owner, and other stakeholders attend.
There is a demo of the product.

Feedback and brainstorming on future directions is encouraged, but no commitments are made during the meeting.
Later at the next Sprint Planning meeting, stakeholders and the team make commitments."
\end{quote}

At our meeting, the Scrum master of the \giraf project started with a short presentation, and then gave the floor to the groups\jesper{Describe the context of the \giraf project early in the report.}, who spent five minutes each demonstrating their progress to the stakeholders\jesper{In aforementioned context description, define the stakeholders of the \giraf project}. 
After the demonstrations, the stakeholders left, and the groups that would not continue working on the same project (\giraf application) for the next sprint, proceeded to distribute these projects among them, in preparation for the second sprint.

We do not consider this sprint review meeting a success, due to the following reasons:
\begin{itemize}
	\item It was a one-way meeting, where the stakeholders were presented with the progress, but were not encouraged to give any feedback. 
	As a result, the development teams had no gain from the meeting, and were ill prepared for the second sprint. 
	This problem was exacerbated by the lack of the sprint planning meetings required in Scrum to start a new sprint.
	As \citet[p. 70]{larmanAgile} describes, during the sprint planning meetings, goals are re-prioritized and a new sprint backlog is created. 
	\item Several of the demonstrations had technical problems, such as applications crashing in the emulator used for the demonstration.
	This surprised the presenting groups, and thus they were unable to demonstrate their actual progress.
	A related problem was that several groups did not direct their presentation towards the costumers, and therefore focused on technical details, using a very technical vocabulary.
	The demonstration should be better prepared, with more focus on the actual goal of the meeting.
	\item Not all stakeholders were able to attend, as the meeting was planned at a relative late date beforehand.
	As the main goal of the meeting is for the stakeholders to review the progress of the project, this is not optimal.
\end{itemize}

These problems were discussed after the conclusion of the meeting. 
It was suggested that a possible root problem was the \giraf Scrum master being overworked with planning this meeting along with his other responsibilities.
It was decided to, at a later date, discuss the possibility of designate another person as responsible for conducting the sprint review meeting, and possibly the sprint planning meetings as well.

Since we were not able to get any feedback to process for the beginning of the next sprint (\cref{chap:sprint2}), any further work of the \launcher is to be decided during next sprint meeting (\cref{sec:sprint2:overview}).
