\subsection{Launcher improvements}
\thilemann{Remember intro}

\subsubsection{Highlight of Application Icons}
It was desired to have visual effect for when a colour was dragged over an application icon.
This was achieved by scaling up the selected application icon (the icon over which the colour is being dragged) by 10\% on \lstinline{DragEvent.ACTION_DRAG_ENTERED,} and scaling it down again on \lstinline{DragEvent.ACTION_DRAG_EXITED} and \lstinline{DragEvent.ACTION_DRAG_ENDED}.

\subsubsection{Loading Animation on Application Start}
The 2012 report by \citet{launcher2012} mentions how an animation in the main activity would make it clear to the user that the application is starting and running (e.g. loading data).
This was made by defining a custom animation and launching the it in \lstinline{MainActivity}. \thilemann{Write a little more about this}
