\subsubsection{Launcher improvements}

\subsubsection*{Highlighting and Dehighlighting Application Icons when Dragging Colour}
It was desired to have visual effect for when a colour was dragged over an application icon.
This was achieved by scaling up the selected application icon (the icon over which the colour is being dragged) by 10\% on \lstinline{DragEvent.ACTION_DRAG_ENTERED,} and scaling it down again on \lstinline{DragEvent.ACTION_DRAG_EXITED} and \lstinline{DragEvent.ACTION_DRAG_ENDED}.

\subsubsection*{Loading Animation on Application Start}
The 2012 report by \citet{launcher2012} mentions how an animation in \lstinline{MainActivity} would make it clear to the user that the application is running normally.
This was made by defining a custom animation, \lstinline{logoanimation.xml}, and launching the animation in \lstinline{MainActivity}.
