\subsection{Improved Behaviour of the Drawer}
As mentioned in \cref{sec:launcher:drawer}, the drawer is opened by pressing and dragging the vertical bar to the right.
The code working the animation of the drawer is based on an touch listener, using a motion event which is fired only by movement.
The event sets the position of the entire drawer, panel and bar to the exact point it has just been moved to before redrawing the elements.
Since the position is not limited, the user can leave it in any position between fully extended and closed state as explained in \cref{sec:drawer:behaviour}.

To change this behaviour an Android \lstinline{TranslateAnimation} is implemented to start as soon as the user touches the vertical bar of the drawer.
A \lstinline{boolean} variable determines whether the drawer is open or closed to force the animation to either translate left or right depending on its current state.
By also adding an \lstinline{OnDragListener} to the drawer, the animation would also play when dragging and dropping colours from the panel; closing the drawer when a drag is initiated and closing it again when the drag has ended.
