\subsection{Minor Bugs}

Several minor bugs, anomalies and things that did not work as expected were found in the beginning of the spring.
Considering their negligible significance, we will not discuss them in depth, but rather describe each briefly.

\subsubsection{Child Mode}
Regardless of whether the currently logged in profile is a child or a guardian, \launcher opens the \lstinline{ProfileSelector} before opening an application.
It should only open that activity while using a logged in guardian profile.
The issue is solved by checking on the \lstinline{getRole()} parameter of a profile and then appropriately override the \lstinline{OnClickListener} of the profile selector dialog, depending on the role. 

\subsubsection{Force Landscape Mode}
It is clear from reading previous reports describing \launcher that landscape mode should be forced in all \giraf applications.
Since \launcher is the only application able to enter portrait mode, it is corrected by changing \lstinline{AndroidManifest.xml} to only allow landscape mode for all activities, which contains essential information that is used by the Android system to control its behavior\cite{appManifest}.

\subsubsection{Issues related to other groups}
Two issues caused by other projects are also discovered:

\begin{itemize}
\item The \lstinline{GButton} widget from \textit{GIRAF Components} library crashes any activity that implements it.
\item Danish characters are not encoded correctly in the database.
\end{itemize}

The issues are reported to the groups responsible for these components through our issue tracker, which in effects handles their responsibility over to the other groups.
