\subsection{Minor Bugs}

There were several minor bugs, anomalies and things that did not work, when the sprint started.
Considering their negligible significance, we will not discuss them in depth, but rather describe each briefly.
There was also a number of issues so insignificant, that they are not mentioned here.

\subsubsection*{Child Mode}
Regardless of whether the currently logged in profile was a child or a guardian, \launcher would open the \lstinline{ProfileSelector} before opening an application.
It should only open that activity, while in a guardian profile was logged in.
The issue was solved by checking the \lstinline{getRole()} parameter of a profile and then appropriately override the \lstinline{OnClickListener}, depending on the role. 

\subsubsection*{Force Landscape Mode}
\launcher was the only application able to enter portrait mode. 
All other \giraf applications where configured to only work in landscape mode.
\launcher's \lstinline{AndroidManifest.xml} was edited to only allow landscape mode for all activities.

\subsubsection*{Issues related to other groups}
We also discovered two issues that turned out to be caused by other \giraf components. We reported these issues to the groups responsible for these components. The issues were:

\begin{itemize}
\item The \lstinline{GButton} widget from \giraf's GUI library would crash any activity it was used in.
\item Danish characters would not decode correctly from the database.
\end{itemize}
