This section considers the analysis of application launcher based on its current state.
First the launcher is shortly introduced, followed by our motivation for taking over its development.
Next, the functionality of the launcher is described.
Lastly, the section focuses on our desired improvements found by looking at the existing code-base and the report by \citet{launcher2012}, which is the last project group working on the launcher, with emphasis on the drawer component.
