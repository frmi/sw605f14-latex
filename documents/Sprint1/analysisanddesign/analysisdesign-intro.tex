This section considers the analysis of the \launcher based on its current state.
First, the \launcher project is shortly introduced followed by our motivation for taking over its development.
Second, the deeper functionality of the \launcher is described.
Third, the section focuses on our desired improvements found by looking at the existing code-base and the report by \citet{launcher2012} (which is the last project group working on the \launcher), with emphasis on the `'drawer''.\vagner{I'm getting a null-reference on the citation - why?}
Lastly, a functional test is described to find further areas of improvement.
