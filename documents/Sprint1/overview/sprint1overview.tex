The first sprint focused on getting to know the \giraf code base, which we inherited from the students working on the project the previous years. 

This section covers the layout of the first sprint of the project, which sets itself apart from the following sprints, since it focuses on getting to know \giraf in details, setup of the development environment and getting the system up-and-running.

\subsection{Planning}\label{sec:sprint1:planning}
The agenda for the first sprint meeting is to get an overview of the development taken place during the preceding semesters, and to get development started.
To begin with, each group has chosen a \giraf application to work on, even though this selection is subject to change during the following sprints.
We have chosen the to work with the \launcher application, which is further described in \cref{sec:launcher}.

It is also decided that the following tools are used to strengthen cooperation between all project groups:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Redmine} (project management web application)
\item \textbf{Git} (distributed version control system)
\item \textbf{Jenkins} (continuous integration)
\item \textbf{Android Studio} (Android integrated development environment)
\item \textbf{Gradle} (build automation control)
\end{itemize}

This selection differs from that of last year, since Git has replaced SubVersion (SVN), Android Studio has replaced Eclipse and the Gradle buildsystem has replaced Ant.

\subsection{Objectives}\label{sec:sprint1:objectives}
Since this is the first sprint and thus we have no prior knowledge of \giraf, this sprint can not focus on any new developments.
Therefore, attention is given to the work done by last years students working on the project, looking for improvements and fixing bugs.
During the first sprint meeting, it was clear, based on advice from semester coordinator Ulrik Nyman, that we should strive to deliver a functioning suite of applications, especially at the end of the project period.
It should not be understood as a version to be delivered to the clients, but merely as an installable version that can run without any crashes. 

A separate project group was tasked with handling all negotiations with the clients during this first sprint in order to compile a backlog for the second sprint.
They are also undertaking the act of creating a requirements specification for the entire project together with user stories explaining how common tasks are executed.
It can be seen in its entirety in \cref{appendix:requirements}.

The rest of this chapter focuses on the \launcher application.
