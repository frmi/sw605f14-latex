\chapter{First Sprint}\label{chap:sprint1}
The first sprint focussed on getting to know the \giraf code base, which we inherited from the students working on the project the previous year. This sprint also involved some work establishing work flows for the multi-project. In this chapter we describe what tasks we concerned ourselves with during this sprint. We also give a detailed description of \launcher, the component we are responsible for during this sprint.
