We found several candidates for improvements of \launcher.
In this section, we only describe the three we deem have the highest priority.
An exhaustive list of improvements can be found in \cref{appendix:futureworks}.

\section{Copying settings from one user to another}
For many citizens, the settings may be quite similar.
For this reason, it would be preferable to be able to copy settings from one user to another.

\section{Download pictograms while tablet is being used}
When \launcher is started after a reboot of the device the synchronisation i of data with the remote database is done before being able to login.
If \launcher has never been installed on the device before, this means that it can take up to 30 minutes, before it is ready to login.
It would be an idea to only load the necessary information such as profiles, and then continue downloading the pictograms in the background while the tablet is being used.


\section{Use GridView for loading applications}
The layout in which applications are being loaded is of an inconvenient type. 
They should instead be loaded into a \lstinline|GridView|, using a custom adapter similar to the one mentioned in \cref{sec:settingslistadapter}. 
This is better for memory management, follows Android Best Practices and would simplify the algorithm used for showing applications. \vagner{Kilde for at det ville f√∏lge Android Best Practices?}
