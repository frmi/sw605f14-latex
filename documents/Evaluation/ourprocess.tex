While it was decided to use Scrum at the multi-project level, the individual groups were free to use other methods.
We chose to adopt Scrum as well.

The morning Scrums provided a great overview of the tasks to be carried out during the day.
Furthermore, the sprint backlog compiled after each sprint, left us with a good overview of tasks to be completed during each sprint.

However, we deviated from Scrum in several ways.
First of all, we did not use a Scrum Master.
Since our group only consisted of four member, it was deemed to be unnecessary.
Second, though we did have sprint backlogs, they were not as detailed as they should be.
This also lead to many tasks appearing during sprints, which were not accounted for in the sprint backlog, and slowed us down.
Lastly, the act of estimating the time each task would require, was mostly omitted.
While \citet{larmanAgile} points out that this is one of the more difficult parts of Scrum, we rarely even made an attempt to do so.\\

Despite these deviations, it is our general consensus, that the process worked well, probably because a group of this small size, generally needs less formal rituals.
