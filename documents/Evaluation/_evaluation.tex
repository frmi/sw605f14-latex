\chapter{Evaluation}\label{chap:evaluation}

Overall, we believe \launcher fulfilled the requirements of being a running and working application, when the work was concluded at the end of the last sprint.
We also believe that the collective \giraf suite fulfils this requirement.
There are still issues of reliability, as well as ample opportunity for extending the existing features and adding new ones.
However, especially with the addition of the remote database and its huge collection of pictograms, \giraf is very close to becoming a truly useful tool at the client institutions.
