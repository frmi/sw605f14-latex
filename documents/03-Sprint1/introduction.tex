The first sprint lasted from the \vagner{date} till the \vagner{date}.
In the following we will describe the tasks we worked on during this phase of the project period. 
Central activities in the sprint were getting to know the existing codebase, setting up the tools to be used, and initiating the cooperation with the contact persons.

We worked on the system component known as \textit{\launcher}, an interface for accessing other \giraf applications on the device.
Resolving pre-exisiting issues in the program was the main focus - as these were being resolved, focus shifted towards refactoring source code, improving the user experience and the functionality of the application.
The sprint ended with a fully operational \launcher, versioned with the other components of the project.\jesper{What do we mean by this?}
