The first sprint lasted from the \vagner{date} till the \vagner{date}.
In the following we will describe the tasks we worked on during this phase of the project period. 
Central activities in the sprint were getting to know the existing codebase, setting up the tools to be used, and initiating the cooperation with the contact persons.

We worked on the system component known as \textit{Launcher}, an interface for accessing other GIRAF applications on the device.
Resolving pre-exisiting bugs in the program was the main focus - as these were being resolved, focus shifted to refactoring code, improving the user experience and the functionality of the app.
The sprint ended with a fully operational \textit{Launcher}, versioned with the other components of the project.
